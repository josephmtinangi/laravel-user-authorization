# User Authorization in Laravel 5.4 With spatie-laravel-permission

When building an application, we often need to set up an access control list (ACL). An ACL specifies the level of permission granted to a user of an application. For example a user Neema may have the permission to read and write to a resource while another user Joseph may have the permission only to read the resource.
